### Literacy (CiE)

For each of the following, put an 'X' inside the square brackets if it applies.

- [ ] I understood what I was supposed to do for this project.
- [ ] I understood the language elements I was meant to use for this project. 
- [ ] I can see how each of the six things (concepts) could be used on tihs project.

- [ ] I demonstrate consideration of the potential users of my project. 
- [ ] My project is visually coherent.
- [ ] My project was developed thoughtfully.

- [ ] I developed my project in concert with (theoretical) users

### Determination (HiD)

For each of the following, put an 'X' inside the square brackets if it applies.
- [ ] I revised my code throughout the development process. 
- [ ] I employed effective debugging techniques. 
- [ ] I used my resources (notes, previous projects, code examples, documentation, etc.). 
- [ ] I saught help. 
- [ ] I tried to get myself unstuck first.
- [ ] I adjusted the scope of my work appropriately.  

### Documentation (HiD)

For each of the following, put an 'X' inside the square brackets if it applies.
- [ ] There is evidence of my initial goals and planning for this project prior to coding. 
- [ ] There is evidence of revision in plans either prior to coding or as the project progressed.
- [ ] My code is self-documenting (good variable and function names, good encapsulation, etc.) and/or is appropriately commented.
- [ ] Citations are present as appropriate. 

## Engagement

### Originality (HiD)

My final product is, to the best of my knowledge and ability:
- [ ] completely novel
- [ ] a fairly unique twist on something I'd seen
- [ ] a fancy remix
- [ ] kind of a retread
- [ ] superficially unique
- [ ] something other

- [ ] strongly
- [ ] mostly
- [ ] mildly
- [ ] hardly

reflects my personality or a held-interest.

# Reflection

Write about what you learned over the course of this project. Try and frame this meditation around the "six things" (variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops, objects). Also write about your process: how you formulated ideas, how you went about implementing those ideas, how you knew they were or weren't working, what you did in terms of troubleshooting. Resources you used. Your reflections will be evaluated on thoughtfulness, thoroughness, and congruency with the evidence of your work (If, for instance, you say you learned a lot about arrays in a given project, but you don't effectively use arrays in the project, that would be incongruent).
